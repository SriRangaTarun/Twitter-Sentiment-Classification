# Twitter-Sentiment-Classification
This is my work on the Twitter Sentiment Extraction competition on Kaggle. I build a model based on RoBERTa base to classify the sentiment of a tweet as neutral, positive, or negative. I use PyTorch XLA and huggingface transformers to train the RoBERTa sentiment classification model. I use data from the [Twitter Sentiment Extraction](https://www.kaggle.com/c/tweet-sentiment-extraction) competition on Kaggle
