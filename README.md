## Twitter Sentiment Classification
In this project, I build a model based on RoBERTa base to classify the sentiment of a tweet as neutral, positive, or negative. I use PyTorch XLA and huggingface transformers to train the RoBERTa sentiment classification model. I use data from the [Twitter Sentiment Extraction](https://www.kaggle.com/c/tweet-sentiment-extraction) competition on Kaggle. The model classifies sentiment with 91% accuracy on the test data.
